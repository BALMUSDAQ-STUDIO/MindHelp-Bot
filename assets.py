ACTIVITY_TIP="""1. Find Activities You Enjoy
Choose exercises you like, whether it's walking, cycling, dancing, or swimming. Enjoyable activities are easier to stick with and make workouts feel less like a chore.
2. Start Slow and Build Consistency
If youâ€™re new to exercise, start with short sessions (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase. Consistency is more important than intensity at first.
3. Exercise Outdoors
Fresh air and sunlight can boost your mood and reduce stress. Try walking or jogging in a park or nature trail to feel more connected to your surroundings.

Practices like yoga, tai chi, and Pilates combine physical movement with mindfulness, helping reduce stress and improve mental clarity.

Set small, realistic fitness goals. Progress, no matter how small, can boost your confidence and motivation, which positively affects your mental state."""

FOOD_TIP="""Eat a balanced diet â€“ Ensure your meals include a mix of proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. A balanced diet fuels the brain and stabilizes mood.
Increase omega-3 intake â€“ Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds, support brain health and can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Consume whole grains â€“ Whole grains like oats, quinoa, and brown rice help regulate blood sugar levels, which can stabilize energy and mood throughout the day.
Stay hydrated â€“ Drink enough water daily, as dehydration can lead to fatigue and mood disturbances.
Include fruits and vegetables â€“ Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables ensures you get enough vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which are essential for brain function and mental clarity.
Limit sugar and processed foods â€“ High sugar and processed foods can cause energy crashes, mood swings, and increase the risk of mental health issues over time."""

SLEEP_TIP="""1. Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule: "To help regulate your body's internal clock, it's important to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends."
2. Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine: "Engage in calming activities, such as reading or practicing meditation, before bedtime to signal to your body that itâ€™s time to wind down."
3. Limit Screen Time Before Bed: "To avoid disrupting your melatonin production, refrain from using screens for 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep."
4. Optimize Your Sleep Environment: "Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep by keeping it dark, quiet, and cool. This will create an ideal environment for restorative rest."
5 .Watch Your Diet: "Be mindful of your evening meals. Try to avoid heavy foods, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime, as these can interfere with your sleep quality."
6. Exercise Regularly: "Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days. However, avoid vigorous workouts in the hours leading up to bedtime, as they can be stimulating."
7. Manage Stress: "Incorporate relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness practices into your evening routine to help alleviate anxiety before sleep."
8. Limit Naps: "If you need to nap, keep it shortâ€”about 20 to 30 minutesâ€”and avoid napping in the late afternoon to prevent interference with nighttime sleep."
9. Seek Natural Light: "Try to spend time outdoors in the morning. Natural light exposure helps regulate your circadian rhythm, enhancing your ability to fall asleep at night."
10. Consider Professional Help: "If you continue to experience sleep difficulties despite making these changes, it may be beneficial to consult a healthcare professional for further support." """

ACTIVITY_TIP="""1. Find Activities You Enjoy
Choose exercises you like, whether it's walking, cycling, dancing, or swimming. Enjoyable activities are easier to stick with and make workouts feel less like a chore.
2. Start Slow and Build Consistency
If youâ€™re new to exercise, start with short sessions (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase. Consistency is more important than intensity at first.
3. Exercise Outdoors
Fresh air and sunlight can boost your mood and reduce stress. Try walking or jogging in a park or nature trail to feel more connected to your surroundings.
4. Incorporate Mind-Body Exercises
Practices like yoga, tai chi, and Pilates combine physical movement with mindfulness, helping reduce stress and improve mental clarity.
5. Set Achievable Goals
Set small, realistic fitness goals. Progress, no matter how small, can boost your confidence and motivation, which positively affects your mental state."""

FOOD_TIP="""Eat a balanced diet â€“ Ensure your meals include a mix of proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. A balanced diet fuels the brain and stabilizes mood.
Increase omega-3 intake â€“ Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds, support brain health and can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Consume whole grains â€“ Whole grains like oats, quinoa, and brown rice help regulate blood sugar levels, which can stabilize energy and mood throughout the day.
Stay hydrated â€“ Drink enough water daily, as dehydration can lead to fatigue and mood disturbances.
Include fruits and vegetables â€“ Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables ensures you get enough vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which are essential for brain function and mental clarity.
Limit sugar and processed foods â€“ High sugar and processed foods can cause energy crashes, mood swings, and increase the risk of mental health issues over time."""
